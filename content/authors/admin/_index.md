I'm a Ph.D. student at the Department of Information Engineering (DII) of the University of Pisa, under the supervision of Prof. [Stefano Giordano](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/S_Giordano) and Prof. [Gregorio Procissi](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gregorio_Procissi). My main research interests are in the subjects of Network Monitoring, Software Defined Networks, Parallel Computing, High-Performance Computing. During my Master's thesis I had the possibility of being more familiar with the topic of Data Stream Processing and I'd be very interested in further exploring this research area with a focus on real-time applications in the networking domain.
