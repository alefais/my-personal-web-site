I'm a Ph.D. student in the Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa. I received both my Bachelor's and Master's Degrees from the Department of Computer Science, University of Pisa. During my Master Degreeâ€™s thesis, I started approaching the data stream processing research area. My main research interests are related to data stream processing applications in the networking domain, high performance network processing, data plane acceleration, SmartNICs and software defined networks. If you have any question related to my work, please feel free to [contact me](#contacts).
