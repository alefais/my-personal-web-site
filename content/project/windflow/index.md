title: WindFlow
summary: Contribution to the WindFlow library, designed to perform parallel stream processing on shared-memory systems. This is a project of the Parallel Programming Models ([PPMs](http://calvados.di.unipi.it/paragroup/)) group at the Department of Computer Science, University of Pisa, Italy. My contribution mainly consists in the implementation of a benchmark composed by four real-time streaming applications in the fields of fraud detection, Internet of Things, vehicular traffic monitoring and word frequency analysis.
