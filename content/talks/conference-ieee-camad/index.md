summary: 
abstract: "The talk is part of the Next Generation Networks session of the 2020 25th IEEE CAMAD Virtual Conference, and it aims at presenting our accepted paper titled \"Data Stream Processing in Software Defined Networks: Perspectives and Challenges\". This work proposes a new approach for the design of efficient network applications in the context of software defined networks based on the adoption of Data Stream Processing computational paradigm to improve the achievable performance through parallelism. The importance of improving scalability and performance aspects in modern softwarized networks by exploiting their flexibility and programmability is thoroughly discussed. A methodology for improving scalability through a two-layer design for network applications (minimizing the controller workload), and for improving performance through the adoption of the DaSP model for accelerating data processing at both data and control planes is presented."
