Teaching support for the laboratory part of the course Wireless Networks at the University of Pisa. The "Virtualization Lab" module had the aim of introducing the concepts of virtualization, hypervisors, virtual machines and containerization. In particular, the focus has been put on Docker by describing the Docker architecture and objects, Dockerfile and best practices and Docker Compose. One last section has been devoted to introduce the students to the concepts of cloud computing, Software Defined Networks and Network Function Virtualization. Finally, the Red Hat OpenStack cloud computing platform has been described.
